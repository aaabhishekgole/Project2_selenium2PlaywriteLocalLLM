# Findings

## Research
- Need to research best practices for Java -> JS AST parsing or LLM-based translation prompts.

## Discoveries
- User wants a **UI-based** workflow.
- Input is pasted Source Code (Java).
- Output is displayed in UI + Saved to File.

## Constraints
- **Stack**: React/Vite (likely) for UI to ensure "WOW" factor.
- **Logic**: Must handle TestNG annotations (@Test, @BeforeMethod, etc.)
- **Aesthetic**: Premium, dark mode, glassmorphism.
- **Conversion**: Prioritize readability over strict 1:1.
